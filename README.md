> **Turn natural language into responsive websites in seconds.**

**Chat 2 Code** is a generative AI tool that enables users to build, style, and iterate on web pages using simple English prompts. It features a real-time **split-screen interface** where users chat with an AI agent on one side and see their code render live on the other.

## ✨ Key Features

* **🗣️ Natural Language to Code:** simply type *"Create a modern landing page for a coffee shop with a dark theme"* and watch the code generate.
* **🖥️ Real-Time Split-Screen Rendering:** Instant visual feedback. As the AI writes the HTML/CSS, the preview pane updates automatically.
* **🤖 Context-Aware Refinement:** The AI remembers previous context. You can say *"Make the header font bigger"* or *"Change the button color to blue"* without restating the whole prompt.
* **⚡ Modern Tech Stack:** Built with Python (Flask) for the backend and vanilla JavaScript for a lightweight frontend.
* **💾 Download Source:** One-click export of the generated HTML and CSS files.
